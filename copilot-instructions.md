# Evaluation criteria

It works. Can we accomplish all required tasks? (/)

It looks decent. We will not argue about matters of taste, and this is a test for UX Engineers rather that
visual designers, but the application should look clean and tidy. (/)

It is responsive. Does it look and work equally well on different size screens from mobile to large desktop? (/)

It is usable. While the requirements do not specify details, the application should help the user avoid
errors, and recover from those. It should also be easy and pleasant to use. (/)

It is accessible. Could a blind person use it? How well does it comply with WCAG 2.2 AA? (?)

It is maintainable. Is the code clear, concise and understandable? Is the use of external dependencies
reasonable? Does it have tests? (/)

It is simple. You are free to use any frameworks and libraries you wish, but bear in mind that we appreciate
simplicity. (/)
